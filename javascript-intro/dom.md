# DOM

When you write HTML and view it in the browser, the browser turns your HTML into something that is called the **Document Object Model** or **the DOM**.

That is what you see when you go to the elements panel in the browser developers tools on any website.

It is not actually just the HTML that you have written, it takes that, converts it to the **Document Object Model**, and it allows us to interface with the DOM via JavaScript.

* We can do things like listen for clicks and scrolls.
* We can add, move, remove elements from that page or things like text, images, etc.
* We can add and remove CSS classes from elements which can trigger animations.
* We can fetch new data.
* We can play music and video.
* We can add any type of interaction to the page.
* ... and that is done by writing JavaScript that interfaces with the DOM \(the things that are on the page, the elements on the page\).

The DOM is represented in a tree that looks very much like HTML.
