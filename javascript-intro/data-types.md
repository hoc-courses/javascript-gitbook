# Data Types

So far, we've only seen strings in our examples. This is just one "type" of data. The collection of types are called data types.  JavaScript has prioritized ease-of-use over precision and therefore it has a small set of data types that programmers need to remember.

The following are the main data types in JavaScript:

### Number

In JavaScript there is a single data type for representing all numeric data. A number is used to  represent integers as well as floating point numbers. In order to store such a wide range of numbers, JavaScript uses 64 bits of storage in memory to store a number.

### String

A string represents a sequence of characters. Strings must be enclosed in quotes. JavaScript allows quotes to be single or double.

### Boolean

The boolean datatype describe data that has only two values: true or false.
