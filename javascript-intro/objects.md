# Objects

An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality \(which usually consists of several variables and functions â€” which are called properties and methods when they are inside objects.\)

The basic idea of Object-oriented programming \(OOP\) is that we use objects to model real world things that we want to represent inside our programs.

Objects can contain related data and code, which represent information about the thing you are trying to model, and functionality or behavior that you want it to have. 

As you've been going through these examples, you have probably been thinking that the dot notation you've been using is very familiar. That's because you've been using it throughout the course! Every time we've been working through an example that uses a built-in browser API or JavaScript object, we've been using objects, because such features are built using exactly the same kind of object structures that we've been looking at here, albeit more complex ones than in our own basic custom examples.
