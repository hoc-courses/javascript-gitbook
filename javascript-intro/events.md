# Events

In Scratch there are lots of different events that your program can respond to.  The one below initiates the code connected to it when the user clicks the green flag icon.

In a web application, your JavaScript code can similarly respond to events from the web browser. For example, you can respond to a button click by registering some JavaScript code to run when the button is clicked.

```markup
<body>
    <button onclick="alert('hello, world');">Click me</button>
</body>
```
