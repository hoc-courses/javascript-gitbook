# JavaScript Intro



There are three core components that all web pages are built on. We're now at the point in the course where we are going to focus on JavaScript, and how it adds interactivity to a web site.

JavaScript is a programming language that was invented specifically to run within a web browser. It is the **ONLY** programming language that works within a web browser.

The video we watched of the Harvard CS50 course demonstrated the graphical Scratch programming language. JavaScript has many of the same capabilities as Scratch, but it is a text-based language, so it's a little less friendly.

We can compare a lot of the programming features in JavaScript to blocks we’ve already seen and used in Scratch. The details of the syntax are far less important than the ideas, which we’ve already been introduced to.ld'\)"/&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;

 When writing code, we might consider the following qualities:

* **Correctness**, or whether our code works correctly, as intended.
* **Design**, or a subjective measure of how well-written our code is, based on how efficient it is and how elegant or logically readable it is, without unnecessary repetition.
* **Style**, or how aesthetically formatted our code is, in terms of consistent indentation and other placement of symbols. Differences in style don’t affect the correctness or meaning of our code, but affect how readable it is visually.
