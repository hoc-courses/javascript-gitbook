# JavaScript Intro

There are three core components that all web pages are built on. We're now at the point in the course where we are going to focus on the JavaScript programming language, and how it is used to add interactivity to a web site.

In the early competition between major web browsers,  a developer at Netscape, invented JavaScript to make web pages more dynamic. It was designed to be accessible to web developers and graphic designers, not your typical software engineer, so that they could add interactivity, such as small animations.

As the sophistication of web applications  has grown, the JavaScript language has also evolved. It remains the only programming language that can be used within a web browser, but has been extended to be able to run outside of a web browser. In particular it is now possible to build a web server in the JavaScript language.  It is the only language that can be used to build an entire web application and for this reason, has become the most popular programming language and a critical skill to know in order to become a successful web developer.
