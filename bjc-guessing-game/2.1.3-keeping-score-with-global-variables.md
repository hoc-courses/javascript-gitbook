# 2.1.3 Keeping Score with Global Variables

**On this page, you will use a global variable to keep score in your Click Alonzo game.**

**In your Number Guessing Game, you used script variables to store information \(the value of secret number\) that only one script needed. To keep score in Click Alonzo, more than one script will need access to that information, so you'll use a global variable.**

**If multiple scripts need access to a variable, or if the information in that variable needs to be saved with your file, you'll use a global variable. Otherwise use script variables.**

1. **Open your U1L1-ClickAlonzo project, play the game, and review the code so you remember how it works.**
2. **Save this as "U2L1-ClickAlonzo"**
3. **Be sure to rename your project with "U2" in the filename. If you save this work under the old filename, Snap! will overwrite your Unit 1 project. Use "Save as..." to save with the new name. When you load an older project and are about to make a big change, get in the habit of saving first, before you change anything.**
4. **Create a global variable named score. Here's how.**
5. **Making a Global Variable**
   1. **Click** ![make a variable button](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wSwOEeMCXWtjCeycb0ZpSCaadUv10IpPQkQoK4PcCr0dE6xN51lhNtKRcHpfvLMeS6WnRsLAei3YXP_jnGa7QLSQ30xJrunV-qQEdS9FEOSmtupw2CZC812qC1DXCse7XOrJRG0) **in the Variables palette. \(It's not a block; you can't drag it into the scripting area.\)**
   2. **Type the title for your variable. In this case, it's score. Click OK.**
6. **You can use** ![change score by \(1\)](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xGycKuDe-S1HjHqhSO_LH-aCkS-oOE_lt2gLdEjmTysS5a0vYuBZbbnvYCsbnnlsF_nyTojBLrpbfCKd17lzxrce5draM0vwaqxjAOhHf4r0tEGwcCVoNBLSdPsq6Fsjwu8pArY) **or** ![set-score-to-score-plus-one](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/MVn4B3F_rL8IBLziMWeUIFkF7Kk4i41eNWLPyIbb4cJIvbNpkS-4m_uma9pAcPoso2NTcuuVBfzCWwG54pOXdjU0iiOehUEYpl2YLfEVeNk5pV0z509ZIojh1Iyesuh2QlELqsI)**. The AP CSP Exam represents the same code this way:**
7. **score ‚Üê score + 1**
8. **Use the score variable to keep track of the player's score:**
   1. **Initialize score to 0 at the beginning of the game.**
   2. **Make the program change the score by 1 whenever the sprite is clicked.**
9. **Test and debug. Play the game enough to make sure that the score variable works.**
10. **Right now, the game never ends, but you'll change that. Decide on the score that you will use to test whether the player has won.**
11. **Use a conditional to determine when the player reaches that score. When they do:**
    1. **Stop all but this script so Alonzo stops jumping around.**
    2. **Make Alonzo appear again. \(You'll have to reset the ghost effect.\)**
    3. **Congratulate the player for a few seconds.**
    4. **If necessary, use another stop block to stop the running script. \(Whether you need this will depend on your program structure.\)**
12. **Test and debug. Take turns playing, and fix any bugs.**

 **Try this if you finish early.**

1. **If the sprite moves without being clicked, make the score go down by 1.**
