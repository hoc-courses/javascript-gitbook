# Simplifying a Tic-Tac-Toe Board

In a previous lab, we used a `repeat` block to avoid duplicating code. Similarly, we can use a custom block to avoid duplicating code. Below is some code to draw a tic-tac-toe board. Your goal is to create blocks that make this code simpler.

Some things to remember:

* As a first step, break up this drawing task into meaningful sub-tasks. We suggest doing this working with pen and paper, not while looking at the code!
* Give your new blocks appropriate names. You want to make it easy to read the code—at its best, like natural, english sentences— and understand what it does.
* It may make sense to "split" some blocks up into different custom blocks. For instance, a single ![turn left 180 degrees](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/blocks/turn-left-180.png) might be better performed as a ![turn left 90 degrees](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/blocks/turn-left-90.png) in one custom block followed by a ![turn left 90 degrees](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/blocks/turn-left-90.png) in another.
