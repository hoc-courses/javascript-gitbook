# Composition of Functions

Consider the ![](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/building-blocks/max-3-arg.png) block definition below:![Script for &apos;max&apos; with three arguments](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/building-blocks/max-3-arg-code.png)

Using similar methodology, your challenge is to make the following blocks work by composing several functions together \(and then maybe a little extra work\):

1. A three-input addition operator that accepts only numbers.![Three-argument addition operator](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/prog/3-arg-addition-block-BYOB.gif)
2. A reporter block named "sum of two smallest" that takes three numbers as inputs, and reports the sum of the two smallest \(the example shown below would report 9\):![sum of two smallest block](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/cond/sum-of-two-smallest.png)
3. A predicate block named "Are any equal?" that compares 3 numbers and returns true if any two are equal to each other \(the example shown below would return true\):![Are any equal? predicate block](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/building-blocks/composition-are-any-equal.png)
