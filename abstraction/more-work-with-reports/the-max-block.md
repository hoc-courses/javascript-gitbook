# The max block

We are going to look more closely at the custom `max` block. Recall, ![](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/blocks/max.png) takes two numbers as input and reports the bigger value \(the maximum\).![max block being executed](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/prog/max-block-executed.png)

Mark Zuckerberg shows you his version of `max` that doesn't seem to be working correctly:[![Buggy max code](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/building-blocks/max-code-buggy.png)](http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#open:https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/prog/building-blocks/max-buggy.xml)

1. Try to predict what this `max` block reports for various input values. If you need extra help click on the picture above to go to a Snap_!_ file containing the code.
2. With a fellow student, describe how to fix the faulty `max` block. What confusion did Mr. Zuckerberg seem to have?
