# Lab - For Loop

## Looping with a Counter <a id="looping-with-a-counter"></a>

In the previous lab, when you were drawing shapes, you used the **repeat** block to loop a specific number of times.

In this lab, you will use the **for loop** block to repeat and count the repetitions so you can use the counter to draw shapes with repeated patterns.

You can use ![](https://github.com/hoc-labs/images/blob/main/for.png?raw=true) to name a variable \(here, ![](https://github.com/hoc-labs/images/blob/main/variable-i.png?raw=true)\) that counts each repetition, and you can use that counter variable in the repeating script. 

For example, the **for** block lets you simplify long scripts like the one below. Each time the **for** block runs the script inside, it changes the value of the variable by 1.

## Lab Exercises

### Build the script above

Then modify it so that the sprite says 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, ... up through 30.

### **Build the following script**

* Make sure you can explain why the square spirals outward.
* Try switching the order of the 100 and the 1 in the for block in the script. What is the result?
* Try changing the turning angle in the script to other numbers such as 92, 126, etc.
* Change the inputs to turn and move to get as close as you can get to a smooth spiral

### Predict what this script will do and then build it to see what happens

### Extra Challenge

Open your [**Drawing Polygons Lab**](lab-drawing-polygons.md)\*\*\*\*

* Build a **nest squares** block that uses a **for loop** block and your **draw polygon** block to draw nested squares. Give it an input so that it will draw whatever number of squares you specify, with each square larger than the previous.
* Build a **nest polygons** block that accepts the number of polygons and the number of sides for the polygons.
* Build a script that draws 12 regular polygons, each with one more side than the previous one, as shown below.

### Find a way to use **for loop** to nest squares this way. 

Build your block with two inputs that let you specify how many squares the design will contain and how much bigger each square will be than the previous one.
