# Operators

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%284%29.png)

Click the Operators tab to display a new palette of blocks. You can use these blocks to perform mathematic operations to modify a numeric variable.

You have blocks to add, subtract, multiple and divide. You also have a mod block that does remainder division as well as a round block and a square root block.

NOTE: To see what any block does, right click on a block in the palette and select help. A new window will open that will explain what that block does.
