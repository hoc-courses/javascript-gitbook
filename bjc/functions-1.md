# Functions

### What is a Function? 

In most programming languages, we can take individual instructions and put them in a new block that we can define

* These new blocks are called functions or procedures because they perform a function for us.
* We can create our script \(or code block\) once and use it as many times as we want without having to re-write the code. 
* We only need to “call” or “invoke” it. 
* This is called **Procedural Abstraction**.
