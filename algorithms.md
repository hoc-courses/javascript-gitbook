# Algorithms

Algorithms are a fundamental part of Computer Programming and of Computing Science

### Problem Solving Tools

* Programs are created to solve problems.
* A solution must be designed prior to coding. 
* One method of designing a solution to a problem is to create an algorithm.

### Algorithms

* An algorithm is a list of steps to solve a problem written in plain English. 
* Steps to solve a problem are written out and numbered in the order in which they should be executed. 
* They should be as extensive as necessary to outline the solution. 
* Your algorithm is not only going to tell your program what to do but how to do it.

### Algorithm Example - Washing Your Hands

1. Turn on the faucet
2. Put your hands under the faucet
3. Reach for bar of soap in the soap dish with one hand
4. Lather the soap with both hands 
5. Return the soap to soap dish
6. Put your hands under the faucet
7. Rub hands until all soap is removed
8. Turn off faucet
9. Dry hands 

### Programming Example Algorithm

Simple steps representing a process for dealing with a guessing game in which the computer generates a random number and the player guesses. 

1. Generate a secret random number between 1 and 100. 
2. Get a number from the player. 
3. Compare the player’s guess to the secret number. 
4. Compare the numbers. If the numbers are identical, go to step 5. Otherwise, tell the player the number was either too high and return to step 2. 
5. Display a message stating the secret number was guessed.

### Pseudocode

* Pseudocode is a mix of English language and code that represents what you want your program to do. 
* It helps you determine how you want the program to work as well as what variables and methods/functions you will want to include. 
* Developing pseudocode will help you work through your logic, reducing the number of errors and potential re-writes you will have to do.

### Pseudocode Example

Represents the same process for dealing with a guessing game in which the computer generates a random number and the player guesses the number.

```bash
btnCheckGuess_Click() 
    randomNumber = 37 
    Get playerGuess from text box 
    If playerGuess = randomNumber Then 
        Display “Correct” 
    ElseIf playerGuess < randomNumber Then 
        Display “Guess too Low” 
    Else 
        Display “Guess too High” 
    End
```

### Flowchart

* A third tool in programming is through the use of a flowchart. 
* Flowcharts use symbols and text to give a visual representation of a solution to a problem.
* The direction of the arrows indicates the flow of the logic.
* Flowcharts help the programmer begin to plan the programming project. 
* They provide a visual representation of the algorithm or process. 
* They describe the inputs, processes and outputs of the program that are needed to successfully complete the project.

### Errors in Algorithms

There are many famous errors in computer errors. These are caused by the wrong instructions in the program. The instructions were interpreted by the computer in a way not intended by the program designer.

#### Why are they hard to develop? 

* Must be unambiguous 
* Must be correct 
* Must be at the right level of detail

### Some Activities that are not Algorithmic in Nature

* Problem solving 
* Human thinking process 
* Falling in love 
* and so on…

When we can express the human thinking process as an algorithm, Artificial Intelligence will have truly been created.

### Summary

* An algorithm is a step-by-step method for accomplishing a task
* Following an algorithm ◦ relatively easy
* Finding/designing algorithms is difficult, but exciting and fulfilling
* The designed algorithm contains the intelligence of its developer
* If you do not understand the problem, you probably will not be able to create a solution.
