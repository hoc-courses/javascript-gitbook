# Follow that Mouse!

What do you think the following script will do?![Follow That Mouse Script](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/blocks/follow-that-mouse.png)

Hint: ![Mouse X Reporter](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/blocks/mouse-x.png) and ![Mouse Y Reporter](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/blocks/mouse-y.png) are reporters in the **Sensing** palette; they tell you where the mouse is pointing.

Open [the program](http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#open:https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/prog/loop/follow-that-mouse.xml) \(click on the forever block to run it\). Did it follow your expectations?

Drag the mouse to a different part of the screen while the program is running and see what happens!

**Try this:** change the go to block to look like this:

![Go
                To X+60 Script](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/topic1/xplus60.png)

How does this change the program's behavior?
