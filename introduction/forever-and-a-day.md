# Forever and a Day

From the previous exercise, you may have figured out what the ![Forever block](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/blocks/forever.png) block does. The **forever** block is the first block you have see that holds, or wraps around, other blocks. We call this a _C block_ because of its shape. As the name **forever** implies, it will run the blocks inside it again and again and again and ... well, forever. You will find this block under the **Control** tab.![Forever And a Day Script](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/intro/the-person-kept-talking-and-talking.png)

Will a ![Forever block](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/blocks/forever.png) block ever stop?  
  
Not unless you tell it to: Click on the stop sign icon on the upper right hand corner of the Snap_!_ window.  
![Stop button](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/topic1/stopbutton.png)

This stop sign will stop all scripts that are running in any sprite. This is equivalent to executing the ![stop all block](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/blocks/stop-all.png) in the `Control` palette.
