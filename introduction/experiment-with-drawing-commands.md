# Experiment with Drawing Commands

Try to get comfortable with the blocks under the **Motion** tab and the **Pen** tab. Figure out what each one does, and try to use these blocks to draw a square or a simple picture. Get started by testing these blocks:

![Move 10 Steps Block](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/blocks/move-10-steps.png)

![Turn Right 15 Degrees Block](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/blocks/turn-right-15.png)

![Clear Block](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/blocks/clear.png)

![Pen Down Block](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/blocks/pen-up.png)

### Tips and Tricks:

1. Once the pen is down, it stays down even in a different script. Use the `pen up` block to lift the pen so that no lines will be drawn.
2. You also will want to show the direction and x and y position of the sprite. In the Motion tab, you can select for these to be shown on the stage as described in the [Reporters](reporters.md) activity you saw earlier in the lab.
3. Try this: Does the **turn** block change the x or the y position?
