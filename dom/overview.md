# Overview

## Loading the DOM

The DOM is what is generated by the web browser when it reads the text in an HTML document and renders a representation of the document on the screen.

The image below captures the initial process the web browser goes to from reading the HTML document to representing that document as a complex collection of inter-related objects in a tree structure.

## Manipulating the DOM

Not only does the web browser use this object representation for its own purposes, but it also has methods that allow your code to add, remove, and modify the element in the live model of the HTML document.

For example, the following code would immediately change the text color of the h1 element in the document above to red.

```javascript
const element = document.querySelector("h1");
element.style.color = 'red';
```

If we added a button to the HTML code above, we could set up an event handler to respond to a button click and change the color only when the user clicked the button.

```markup
<h1>My header</h1>
<button>Click</button>
```

```javascript
const button = document.querySelector("button");
const element = document.querySelector("h1");

button.addEventListener("click", () => {
  element.style.color = 'red';
});

```

#### Document Methods

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [querySelector](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_queryselector.asp) | Returns the first element that matches a specified CSS selector\(s\) in the document |
| [addEventListener](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_addeventlistener.asp) | Attaches an event handler to the document |

The querySelector method returns an [Element ](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_all.asp)Object, which represents an &lt;html&gt; element, like `<p>`, `<div>`, `<a>`, `<table>`, or any other HTML element within the document.

### Element Object

Here are a few of the properties/methods on the Element object. As you can see, the querySelector method is available on both the Document and Element Object. It just starts the search for the element at different positions in the document tree.

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [attributes](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_node_attributes.asp) | Returns a NamedNodeMap of an element's attributes |
| [childNodes](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_node_childnodes.asp) | Returns a collection of an element's child nodes \(including text and comment nodes\) |
| [querySelector](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_element_queryselector.asp) | Returns the first child element that matches a specified CSS selector\(s\) of an element |
| [style](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_html_style.asp) | Sets or returns the value of the style attribute of an element |

### Style Object

In the code above, we are accessing the style property of the Element object, which provides properties for all of the CSS properties, so that we can dynamically update and of the CSS values. In our case, we  changed the text color by updating the value of the color property to the color red.

In CSS, we specify a style property in a CSS block.

```css
h1 {
    color: red;
}
```

In JavaScript code, through the Style Object, we specify the style property as follows:

```css
const element = document.querySelector("h1");
element.style.color = 'red';
```
