# JavaScript Built-in Objects

## Built-in Objects

In some cases, the objects that are being modelled are so common that the language authors built in objects and provided them so that you can use them in your programs without having to write them yourself.

For example, almost all applications need to store a collection of objects, or lists. In JavaScript, the Array object is built-in and can be used in your program to store a collection of any type of data, such as a collection of numbers, or strings, or even a collection of custom objects that you have defined.

Just like the Pen object in the Snap! program, the Array can be described as a set of properties and methods.

#### Data/Properties

| Variable | Data Type |
| :--- | :--- |
| Length | numeric |
| Elements, accessed with \[index\] | any |

#### Methods

| Name | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| push | add an item to the end of the array |
| pop | remove an item from the end of the array |
| shift | removes the item at the front of the array |
| find | find an item in the array |

Other useful built-in objects include Date, String, Math and Map.
