# Number Guessing Game

## Version 1

In the code sample below, we have implemented a simple number-guessing game. The computer chooses a random number and then asks the player to guess the random number. The code is available in [this file](http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#open:https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/prog/conditionals/guess-number.xml).

The game is not that cool yet, though. In the next few steps, we are going to make the game much more like playing the number-guessing game with a person!

## Version 2

**Challenge \#1**: The sprite should welcome the player and ask for their name before beginning.  
  
**Challenge \#2**: If they guess incorrectly, the sprite should tell them that they are incorrect, using their name. For example, if Colleen is playing the game, the sprite should say something like `Sorry Colleen, that is not the right answer.` before asking them to guess again.  
  
**Challenge \#3**: If they guess incorrectly, the sprite should tell them if the secret number is bigger or smaller than the number that they guessed.  
  
**Challenge \#4**: Right now, the script always picks a number between `1` and `10`. Change this so that it picks a number between `1` and a variable named `maximum`. Ask the player what they would like the maximum number to be, before choosing a random number. Use this maximum number as the highest number that the script will choose.  
  
**Challenge \#5**: Keep track of how many guesses it takes before the player guesses the right number.  
  
**Challenge \#6**: When the player guesses the secret number, tell them how many guesses it took, and congratulate them using their name.
