# Forever Loop

What do you think the following script will do?![Follow That Mouse Script](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/blocks/follow-that-mouse.png)

**Hint**: ![Mouse X Reporter](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/blocks/mouse-x.png) and ![Mouse Y Reporter](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/blocks/mouse-y.png) are reporters in the **Sensing** palette; they tell you where the mouse is pointing.

Open [the program](http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#open:https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/prog/loop/follow-that-mouse.xml) \(click on the forever block to run it\). Did it follow your expectations?

Drag the mouse to a different part of the screen while the program is running and see what happens!

**Try this:** change the go to block to look like this:

![Go
                To X+60 Script](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/topic1/xplus60.png)

How does this change the program's behavior?

## Test for Understanding

From the previous exercise, you may have figured out what the ![Forever block](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/blocks/forever.png) block does. The **forever** block is the first block you have see that holds, or wraps around, other blocks. We call this a _C block_ because of its shape. As the name **forever** implies, it will run the blocks inside it again and again and again and ... well, forever. 

![Forever And a Day Script](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/intro/the-person-kept-talking-and-talking.png)

You will find this block under the **Control** tab.

Will a ![Forever block](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/blocks/forever.png) block ever stop?  
  
Not unless you tell it to: Click on the stop sign icon on the upper right hand corner of the Snap_!_ window.  
![Stop button](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/topic1/stopbutton.png)

This stop sign will stop all scripts that are running in any sprite. This is equivalent to executing the ![stop all block](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/blocks/stop-all.png) in the `Control` palette.
