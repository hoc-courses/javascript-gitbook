# Custom Blocks

## What is a Custom Block? 

In most programming languages, we can take individual instructions and put them in a new code block that we can define. Different languages call them by different names. Some languages call procedures _**methods**_ ****or _**functions**_. Snap! calls them blocks. Snap! as a large repository of built-in code blocks and also lets you define your own.

A **code block** is a named sequence of instructions that may take inputs and may return a value. 

* Code blocks perform a function for us.
* We can create our code block once and use it as many times as we want without having to re-write the code. 
* We only need to “call” or “invoke” it. 
* This is called **Procedural Abstraction**.

There are three categories of code blocks in Snap!:

* **commands** -  tells the computer to do something without returning a value.
* **reporters** - returns a value.
* **predicates** - a type of reporter, returns either true or false
