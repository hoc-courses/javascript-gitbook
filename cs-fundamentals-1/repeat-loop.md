# Repeat Loop

## Don't Repeat Yourself - let Snap! do it for you!

We can use the ![empty repeat-n block](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat.png) block to make drawing shapes a lot easier! You can see below a script to draw a square.

![Square example image](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/prog/prog-create-square-code-BYOB.gif)

\(You can click on the script above to open the script in Snap! in another window. This is indicated by the little ![](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/web/external-link.png) icon that follows it.\)

There are three different numeric values in the script—`4`, `100`, and `90`—that you can think of as parameters that change the resulting picture. Play with the script to understand how each number contributes to the "squareness" of the shape that is drawn.

## Drawing Regular Polygons with Repeat

A regular polygon is a shape in which all the sides are the same length and all the turning angles are the same. A square is a regular 4-sided polygon.[![drawing a square and squiggle](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/looping/drawing-regular-polygons.gif)](http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#open:https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/prog/loop/draw-square-and-squiggle.xml)

Using a ![empty repeat-n block](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat.png) to draw the following regular shapes:

* Equilateral Triangle
* Pentagon
* Hexagon
* Octagon

As you draw regular polygons with more and more sides, you are getting closer and closer to a circle. Is there a point at which is actually \(mathematically?\) a circle?

Save the scripts as you go because, in a following activity, you'll be trying to figure out a pattern.
