# Predict the Output

Below are several blocks that use `if` and `if-else`. Predict what each one will do and discuss it with your neighbor. Once you've done so, you try running each of the blocks, which can be found [here](http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#open:https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/prog/conditionals/predict-if-functions.xml).

You'll notice that a couple of the scripts below use the ![abs \(\)](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/blocks/abs.png) block. This block actually allows you to use many different mathematical functions. It shows up in the palette as ![sqrt \(10\)](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/blocks/sqrt-of-10.png). Just click the drop-down menu to select which function to use. "abs" is short for "absolute value." In case you're not already familiar, the absolute value of a number is just that number turned positive. For example, `abs(10)` is just `10`, while `abs(-2.5)` is `2.5`.
