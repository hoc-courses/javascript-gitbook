# Booleans

In order to represent the yes/no nature of condition phrases, we need a special type of value called a Boolean \(named after the great logician [George Boole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole)\). There are only two possible boolean values: `true` and `false` \(which correspond to "yes" and "no"\). These are represented in Snap_!_ by the blocks ![true](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/blocks/true.png) and ![false](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/blocks/false.png). Blocks that report `true` or `false` are called "predicates."

![5 &amp;gt; 3 returns &apos;true&apos;](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/cond/predicate-returning-boolean.gif)

These functions represent the yes/no questions we were discussing earlier. Predicate functions in Snap_!_ will always have the pointed, hexagonal shape \(like this: ![a predicate block](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/cond/demo-predicate-block.png)\).

Let's take a look at a few simple predicates that are built in to Snap_!_ Most of these can be found on the green "operators" tab.
