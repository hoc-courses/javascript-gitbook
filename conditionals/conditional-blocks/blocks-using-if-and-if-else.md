# Blocks Using If and If Else



Let's try making a few more blocks that use if and if-else.

* Make a ![traffic signal \(\)](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/cond/traffic-signal.png) block that when given a light color, makes the sprite say the appropriate action. For example ![traffic signal \(&apos;green&apos;\)](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/cond/traffic-signal-green.png) should say "go!"
* Make a ![letter grade \(\)](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/cond/letter-grade.png) block that takes in a percentage and makes the sprite say the associated letter grade. For example, ![letter grade \(74\)](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/cond/letter-grade-74.png) should say "C."
* Make a ![state of water \(\)](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/cond/state-of-water.png) block that takes in a temperature and says whether water will be liquid, solid, or gas.
