# Number Guessing Game V1

 In the code sample below, we have implemented a simple number-guessing game. The computer chooses a random number and then asks the player to guess the random number. The code is available in [this file](http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#open:https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/prog/conditionals/guess-number.xml).

The game is not that cool yet, though. In the next few steps, we are going to make the game much more like playing the number-guessing game with a person!
