# Practice with Complex Booleans



Now we're going to write some blocks that utilize predicates like `and`, `or`, and `not`.

* Write a ![weekend \(\_\)](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/cond/weekend.png) block that reports whether a given day is a weekend. Let's assume that only Saturday and Sunday are part of the weekend.
* Write a ![weekday \(\_\)](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/cond/weekday.png) block. You could write this with or without your ![weekend \(\_\)](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/cond/weekend.png) block, but it'll be much easier if you do.
* Here is a block definition. Give it a more descriptive name, then re-write using no `if` blocks.
