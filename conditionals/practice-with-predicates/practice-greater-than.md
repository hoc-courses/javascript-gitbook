We want to make our own _predicate_, a kind of block that reports either `true` or `false`. We have a "greater than" operator \(`>`\), an "equal" operator \(`=`\), and a "less than" operator \(`<`\), but we want a new "greater than or equal to" \(`>=`\) operator.

This isn't really a hard problem, but we've learned from experience that many students have a hard time with it at first. So here are some suggestions if you get stuck.

1. Make sure that you choose the hexagonal `predicate` block shape in the initial `Make a block` dialog.
2. 3. This is an _infix_ operator, i.e., the `>=` block name goes between the two input slots. So you'll have to use the left plus sign in the Block Editor.
4. 5. You'll probably find the Boolean operators helpful, although they're not entirely necessary:  ![and, or, not blocks](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/prog/Booleans.png)
6. 7. There are several correct ways to do this! It's okay if your answer is different from another group's answer, as long as it gives the right `true` and `false` answers.

If you _do_ have trouble with this problem, don't feel bad, but try to understand what's getting in the way, and when you see a solution, learn from it!
