# Defining Reporter Blocks

So far, all of the blocks you've defined have been "command" blocks. These actual carry out an action that affects the state of the program. For example, the `move` block makes the sprite move, and the `say` block makes the sprite say something. We call these effects "side effects."

Sometimes, we aren't interested in any side effects, and just want a block that performs a calculation for us. These are called "reporters," because rather than causing the program to do something, they simply give us back a value. Many blocks on the "operators" palette are reporters. Here are just a few:![a portion of the &apos;operators&apos;
	palette](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/building-blocks/some-reporters.png)

Notice how all of these are rounded, and can't be attached directly to other blocks. Because of this, we need to use them in combination with other blocks, like `say` or `set`. For example:![say \(4 + 7\)](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/cond/say-4-plus-7.png)

\(I'm sure you've been doing things like this since you started using Snap_!_\)

Let's learn how to make our own reporter blocks!

1. The first step is, as usual, to select "make a block" from the bottom of the "variables" palette.
2. Next, we'll select "reporter" rather than the usual "command."

   ![select reporter as block type](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/building-blocks/make-a-reporter.png)Note: you don't have to necessarily put all reporters in the "operators" palette; it's just the most frequent place for them.

3. Once you give your block a name and click "OK," your block definition will look something like this:

   ![empty reporter body](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/building-blocks/my-first-reporter.png)Notice that ![report \(\)](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/blocks/report.png) has automatically been added to the block definition. This is to remind you that all reporter blocks _must_ report a value.

4. Fill in the body with whatever you want, and you're done!

Let's take a look at an example:![square\(x\) block definition](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/building-blocks/square-of-x.png)

This block will take in a parameter `x`, and report `x2`.

Here's a more complex example, using `if`:![homemade absolute value block](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/building-blocks/homemade-abs.png)

This block is a home-made version of the `abs` \(absolute value\) block that we saw earlier. Notice that it contains two `report` blocks. Reporter blocks can have as many `report`s as you want/need.

Let's try writing our own reporter block! Try writing a `max` block that takes in two numbers and reports the larger of the two. Hint: you'll need to use `if`.![empty max\(x, y\) block definition](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/building-blocks/max-block.png)

Here's a more complex block that we wrote. Predict what it will report when run with inputs "hello" and 5.![mysterious block definition](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/building-blocks/join-word-n-times.png)

"Predicates" are special kinds of reporter blocks that only report `true` or `false`. You'll see in the next slide how to write them.
