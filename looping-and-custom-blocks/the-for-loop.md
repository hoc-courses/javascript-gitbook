# The For Loop

![for](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/blocks/for.png)

The numbers in the `for` block work as you probably think they do: the inner script is run enough times to count from the left number \(`1`\) to the right number \(`10`\). As with the `repeat` block, you can change the numbers it comes with by default to change the way the block repeats.

What's new to you here, though, is the orange oval with "`i`" in it. By using this `i`, your inner blocks can know which time through the loop they are currently on. Here's how:

The ![](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/blocks/variable-i.png) block is a _variable_ that acts like a counter. You use it any place you would use a number, and it will report the value that it currently holds.

Think of the _variable_ like a box with a nameâ€”this one has the name `i`. This box is made for you by the ![for](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/prog/for.png) block, and holds a different number each time through the loop. The first time it will hold `1`, or whatever is the left number in the `for` block.

You use it by dragging ![](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/blocks/variable-i.png) from the source within the `for` block down to the slot in which you will use it.
