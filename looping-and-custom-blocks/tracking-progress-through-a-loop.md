# Tracking Progress through a Loop

Repeating a part of your program is a very common practice in programming. We'll call this _looping_, and there many different blocks you can use to do it in many different ways.

The ![](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/blocks/forever.png) block is appropriate if you want to repeat the same behavior for... ever.  
  
The ![](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat.png) block is great if you want to loop the same behavior a certain number of times. 

Sometimes, though, you want to do _almost_ the same thing for a certain number of times, but with a slight variation. For instance:

* You want to draw 20 squares on the screen, but each a different size.
* You want to draw 100 polygons with different numbers of sides.

Many such situations can be handled by the `for` block near the bottom of the Control palette:
