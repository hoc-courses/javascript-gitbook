# Drawing Regular Polygons with Repeat

A regular polygon is a shape in which all the sides are the same length and all the turning angles are the same. A square is a regular 4-sided polygon.[![drawing a square and squiggle](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/looping/drawing-regular-polygons.gif)](http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#open:https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/prog/loop/draw-square-and-squiggle.xml)

Using a ![empty repeat-n block](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat.png) to draw the following regular shapes:

* Equilateral Triangle
* Pentagon
* Hexagon
* Octagon

As you draw regular polygons with more and more sides, you are getting closer and closer to a circle. Is there a point at which is actually \(mathematically?\) a circle?

Save the scripts as you go because, in a following activity, you'll be trying to figure out a pattern.
