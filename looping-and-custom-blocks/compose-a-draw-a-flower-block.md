# Compose a draw a flower Block

Write a block that draws a full flower in the middle of the stage.![draw a flower block](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/drawing/draw-a-flower.png)

Write simple custom blocks, or borrow from blocks you have already written, and then use those blocks inside your `draw a flower` block. If you can, write blocks of intermediate complexity that use and are used by other blocks you write.  
  
You might write:  
  
     `draw flower head with ...`  
  
     `draw stem with length []`  
  
but don't feel constrained by this list.

Use several inputs that control aspects of what the flower should look like. You might change the number of petals, the size of the petals, the shape of the petals, or something else!

After you've worked on this for a bit, take a moment to look at what other students have done and chat. If you see something nice, spend some time trying to incorporate that design into your program.
