# Randomly Moving a Character

Make a sprite keep moving around the screen randomly, using ![pick random](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/blocks/pick-random-empty-args.png) blocks \(with the correct inputs\) inside ![turn right block](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/blocks/turn-right.png) and ![move to](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/blocks/move.png) blocks. Some things to keep track of:

* You'll want to use a ![repeat block](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat.png) or ![forever block](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/blocks/forever.png) to keep your sprite moving continuously.
* Make sure the sprite can travel in any direction.
* How does your sprite's actions change if you have it move a fixed, rather than random, amount each time?
* Keep the pen for your sprite down, and you'll see a two-dimensional [random walk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk).
