A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.

For example, when you look a line of people, how do you tell which person is the tallest? A computer would need explicit, step-by-step instructions, such as:

1. Find the height of the first person
2. Assume he or she is the “tallest person”
3. Look at the height of the remaining people one-by-one and compare their height to the “tallest person” you have found so far
4. At each step, if you find someone whose height is greater than the current “tallest person”, he or she becomes the new “tallest person”
5. Once you have checked all the people, tell me which one is the tallest

So the computer needs to look at each person in turn, and for each one it performs a test \(”Are they taller than the current tallest person?”\). Once it has done this for each person it can give its answer.
