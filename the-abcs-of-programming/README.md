# Jon Duckett Intro

_This is extracted from Jon Duckett's book, JavaScript & jQuery, Chapter 1._

Before you learn how to read and write the JavaScript language itself, you need to become familiar with some key concepts in computer programming. They will be covered in three sections:

**A** - What is a script and how do I create one?

**B** - How do computers fit in with the world around them?

**C** - How do I write a script for a web page?

Once you have learned the basics, the following chapters will show how the JavaScript language can be used to tell browsers what you want them to do.
