# Draw a Polygon

Now, you are going to make a block that takes two inputs.

We want to create a `draw polygon` block that takes as inputs:

1. a number of sides and
2. the length of each side.

![draw polygon \(\) sides of length \(\)](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/img/prog/polyblock.png)

In the block, call these inputs `sides` and `length`. 

You should remember from [this lesson](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/cur/programming/loops/repeat-n/draw-regular-polygons-with-repeat.html) how to draw a regular polygon. How many degrees altogether? How many turns?

Be sure to test out your solution with several polygons, with different lengths and number of sides.
