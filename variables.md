# Variables

### Different Kinds of Variables <a id="different-kinds-of-variables"></a>

We’ve seen a lot of different types of variables.

* **Normal/Global variables**: These variables are made in the regular menu and can be used ANYWHERE! The variable “score” below is an example. _These can be used by any sprite, in any block or in any script_.

* **Sprite Specific Variables**: When you create a “normal/global” variable you can select that the variable is “For this sprite only”. Then these variables will show up as variables listed below the line in the variables tab. _We recommend not using these variables in blocks._

* **Arguments to a function**: A variable set by the person calling the function. We also refer to this as “input”. _This can ONLY be used within the block editor._

* **Script Variables**: The “script variable” block gives us a variable that we can use inside of this script. _These can only be used in that particular script. The script could be a block script \(shown below\) or a regular script._
