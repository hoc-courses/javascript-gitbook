# Lab - Conditionals

Construct each of these scripts and figure out how it works.

You will use what you learn about these scripts to solve the puzzles in problem 2.

Four puzzles: For each picture, create a script \(or modify one you already have\) that keeps the sprite moving in a circle drawing that picture.

![Puzzle 1: circle with northwest circumference red and the rest green, sprite circling clockwise](https://bjc.edc.org/Sept2015/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Challenge1.png) ![Puzzle 2: Circle with southeast circumference thin and the rest thick, sprite circling clockwise](https://bjc.edc.org/Sept2015/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Challenge2.png) ![Puzzle 3: Circle with southwest corner thick and the rest thin, sprite circling clockwise](https://bjc.edc.org/Sept2015/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Challenge3.png) ![Puzzle 4: Circle with the southeast corner thin and the rest thick, sprite circling clockwise](https://bjc.edc.org/Sept2015/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Challenge4.png)

Create a script that lets you write on the stage in two colors, using your mouse:

**Conditional statements:** The blocks `if` and `if-else` allow your programs to perform different actions or computations depending on a _condition_ that you specify.

**Predicates:** As you learned [in Unit 1](https://bjc.edc.org/Sept2015/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/5-block-types-calculations/4-predicates-logic.html), blocks such as ![less than](https://bjc.edc.org/Sept2015/bjc-r/img/blocks/less-than.png) or ![not](https://bjc.edc.org/Sept2015/bjc-r/img/blocks/not.png) that report only ![true](https://bjc.edc.org/Sept2015/bjc-r/img/blocks/true.png)or ![false](https://bjc.edc.org/Sept2015/bjc-r/img/blocks/false.png) are called _predicates._ In Snap, predicates are hexagonal in shape, not oval like other reporters. The values ![true](https://bjc.edc.org/Sept2015/bjc-r/img/blocks/true.png)and ![false](https://bjc.edc.org/Sept2015/bjc-r/img/blocks/false.png) themselves are called _Booleans._
