# Procedures

### What is a Procedure? 

In most programming languages, we can take individual instructions and put them in a new block that we can define.

A **procedure** is a named sequence of instructions \(a code block\) that may take inputs and may return a value. Different languages call them by different names. Some languages call procedures _**methods**_ ****or _**functions**_. 

* These new code blocks are called functions, or procedures, because they perform a function for us.
* We can create our code block once and use it as many times as we want without having to re-write the code. 
* We only need to “call” or “invoke” it. 
* This is called **Procedural Abstraction**.

When you build a new block in Snap, you are creating a procedure.  There are three categories of blocks:

* **commands** -  tells the computer to do something without returning a value.
* **reporters** - returns a value.
* **predicates** - a type of reporter, returns either true or false
